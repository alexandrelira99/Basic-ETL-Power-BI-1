# Basic-ETL-Power-BI-1
Basic ETL using BI for training, specially data transformation

The objective of this ETL was to extract only the process numbers from a very dirty .xlsx archive. At the final we got these process numbers and they Unique ID using conditional columns, delimiting, filtering and extracting. Access the "original" and the "final" archives to see the difference.
